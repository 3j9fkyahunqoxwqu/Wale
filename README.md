Windows Audio Loudness Equalizer

This app controls each app's volume separately and tries to equalize peak levels of each app to the desired level.

It calculates appropriate volume from the average peak level and lowers the volume immediately when the peak exceeds the desired level.
You can configure several parameters such as action timing, a period of average, volume recovery function, target peak level, and so on.
